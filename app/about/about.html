      <p>Merchandise Tracking System</p>
      <p>DROPCO is an application created to increase productivity and save time in a daily routine of Costco merchants. This is done by creating inventory list for merchants and forklift drivers to quickly locate items and bring them to the sales floor.</p>

      <h2>What was solved?</h2>
      <p>Currently, stockers make droplists by hand and then hand deliver them to forklift drivers. With Dropco this process is all automated and now managers can see all items that are being dropped. </p>
